Looking at the values on this table, you can see that two varibles contribute to the impact on miles per gallon. It is the vehicle length and the ground clearance.

I am suprise that the weight of the vehicle doesn't have a more impact on the mpg. I would have also liked to have seen the type of engine and how that might impact both the weight and performance of the vehicle.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Looking at the values on this table, you can see that two varibles contribute to the impact on miles per gallon. It is the vehicle length and the ground clearance.

The collumn that says Pr(<|t|) is the one that we are looking at to determine impact. If it is lower than .05, then it will have a great amount of impact.
I am suprise that the weight of the vehicle doesn't have a more impact on the mpg. I would have also liked to have seen the type of engine and how that might impact both the weight and performance of the vehicle.

Looking at the slope, it seems to be going upwards on the x axis for both slopes.
